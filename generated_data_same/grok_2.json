By eliminating player_5, I might create division among the remaining players and buy more time for survival. Additionally, this vote maintains consistency with my previous actions to avoid drawing more attention to myself."

With only five players left and likely one or two Mafia among us, voting for player_7 could help eliminate a potential threat and prevent reaching parity. I want to support the majority vote from player_3, player_5, and player_6 to maximize our chances of rooting out the Mafia."

Don't overlook player_6's aggressive accusations; it feels like a coordinated effort to hide their own shady maneuvers. Focus on those who play it safe in the shadows, and you might just uncover the truth before it's too late."
