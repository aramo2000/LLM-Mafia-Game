With 9 players left and 3 presumed Mafia, we're at a critical point where eliminating a Mafia member today is essential to maintain our numerical advantage.

Player_9 raises a good point about potential fabrication, so I'd prefer to observe voting patterns today before committing to a vote\u2014it could reveal more suspicious behavior.

While rushing to vote is dangerous, complete inaction also serves the Mafia's interests. I think we should each share our reasoning about why player_4 might have been targeted - perhaps the Mafia feared they were the Detective or particularly observant.

With 3 Mafia still among us and 6 non-Mafia left, another mistaken vote might lead to parity if we're not careful. I want to observe more reactions before committing to any elimination."

Preventing an elimination on Day 1 is strategically beneficial for the Mafia, as it ensures we maintain our numbers advantage relative to the non-Mafia players, setting us up for a win on Night 2.

My vote for player_6 on Day 1 was based on player_7's initial suspicions, which seemed worth exploring at the time, but now player_7's eagerness to target me feels like a deflection tactic, making them a prime suspect.
