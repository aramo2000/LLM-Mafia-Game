Player_8's rush to suspect quiet players like player_3 and player_7 feels like it could be deflection, especially since we still have three Mafia alive among nine players, making any vote risky if based on speculation alone.

I find player_9's questioning of player_8's logical deduction about the Detective dying more suspicious than player_8's initial thoughts \u2013 why try to discredit a reasonable inference?"

Player_4's confirmation about player_0 being innocent suggests they were indeed our Detective, which is a significant loss. I find the alignment between player_8 and player_2 suspicious - they've quickly built on each other's narratives while player_9 raised valid concerns about rushing to judgment. With 6 civilians and 3 mafia remaining, we can safely vote today, but must choose wisely - targeting quiet players benefits mafia by eliminating civilians without solid evidence."

I'm suspicious of player_9 for trying to undermine player_8's logical deductions, as it seems like a deflection tactic to protect potential Mafia allies.

Player 9\u2019s repeated undermining of solid deductions also strikes me as classic Mafia behavior.

The tight pairing of player_8 and player_2 feels too coordinated\u2014they\u2019re pushing a narrative against quiet voices while deflecting attention from themselves.

This aligns with my earlier observation that player_8's rush to suspect others feels speculative and risky, potentially helping the Mafia by dividing the group. With 6 civilians and 3 Mafia among us, it's safer to target players showing suspicious behavior rather than holding off, as a careful vote could reduce Mafia numbers without immediate parity risk."

This also reinforces the suspicion I previously expressed on player_9, potentially shifting focus away from player_1's slip-up.
