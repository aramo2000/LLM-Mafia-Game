Skipping votes (as player_1 suggests) risks giving Mafia momentum\u2014they\u2019d benefit from stalling. Player_8\u2019s early suspicion of player_7 feels forced; Mafia often deflect subtly.

With player_0 eliminated, we now have 9 players including 3 Mafia, so voting prematurely could thin our ranks and edge us toward parity, but stalling might let them pick us off one by one.

Similarly, player_8's premature suspicion of player_7 feels like deflection rather than genuine analysis. While I understand the risk of not voting, we currently have 6 civilians to 3 Mafia, so we can afford to observe one more day before voting, rather than risk eliminating a civilian and giving Mafia more leverage."

There's a lot of uncertainty around player_2's claim and the early suspicions, like those on player_7. I don't have a strong feeling about anyone yet.

Player_2's claim is suspicious, but without concrete evidence from the Detective, eliminating them could backfire. Observing more interactions and allowing the Detective to gather intel overnight is prudent."

Voting for them aligns with my fellow Mafia members' choices, helping us maintain a united front without drawing unnecessary suspicion. This move could disrupt the civilians' strategy and buy us more time."
