Player_5's claim that there are only two remaining Mafia (player_8 and player_9) is mathematically impossible based on the game state and starting numbers. Therefore, player_5's statement is a lie, making them highly suspicious and likely one of the three Mafia.

P3 and P4 are voting incorrectly based on P6's faulty conclusion; we must vote for P8 or P9 to win, and P9 accepted P6's conclusion quickly."
