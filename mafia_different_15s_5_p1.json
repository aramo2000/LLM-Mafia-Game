Given that we can only afford to lose 3 more civilians before reaching parity, I think we should consider skipping this first vote until we have some behavioral patterns to analyze.

I know from my investigations that player_0 and player_9 are not Mafia, so focusing on player_2 could help eliminate a real threat without risking another innocent's life. With the game at a critical point where one wrong vote leads to Mafia parity and victory, this choice aims to steer the group toward a safer elimination."

With 7 players left and 3 Mafia still alive, voting for player_4 could eliminate a threat and prevent us from reaching parity.

Both eliminated players mentioned player_6 alongside me, and this flip reinforces my suspicion that they are involved.

As others have pointed out, the specific knowledge that someone \"isn\u2019t the detective\" is what the Mafia Don learns from their nightly investigation. This makes player_0 a very strong suspect for being the Don, and I believe we should focus on voting them out today."
