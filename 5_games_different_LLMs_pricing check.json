With 3 Mafia among us and 6 non-Mafia, voting today could tip us closer to parity if we err, so we need more discussion to spot inconsistencies before committing.

I'm growing suspicious of player_6 for suddenly speaking up only to deflect attention from themselves after being called out for silence\u2014it feels like a classic evasion tactic.

With multiple votes already against me, voting for player_5 might help break the bandwagon and encourage more discussion. Additionally, player_4's advice to question louder voices aligns with player_5's behavior, making them a potential risk."
