The contrast between player_7's suspicion of player_3 and player_8's quick defense of them is notable. While I understand the call for quiet players like myself to speak up, I think we should focus on inconsistencies or suspicious arguments rather than just silence on Day 1.

I'm also concerned about player_5, who remains completely silent despite multiple callouts. With player_0 eliminated and all three Mafia still active, we need six civilians remaining, making a wrong vote dangerous as we'd be just two mislynches away from Mafia reaching parity.

That said, I've noticed player_1 hasn't shared much, which raises my suspicions, so I'd like to hear their thoughts before we vote.

I find player_7\u2019s quick agreement with every point a bit too convenient; I\u2019d like them to clarify their reasoning before voting.

While I agree with the majority that we shouldn't rush to vote on Day 1, I'm particularly wary of player_6's attempt to push an early vote when we still have nine players with three Mafia among us. For now, I'll hold my vote since a mislynch followed by a night kill would bring us dangerously close to Mafia parity, but I'll be closely watching player_6 and player_7's voting patterns going forward."

Doing so early could help prevent the Mafia from gaining parity by eliminating one of their members."

While player_4 raised good points about quieter players, I'm actually finding player_2's lack of contribution suspicious - they seem to be deliberately staying under the radar. I also noticed player_6 is being overly cautious about voting, which could be a tactic to protect fellow mafia members.
