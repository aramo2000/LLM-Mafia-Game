This pattern of behavior stands out as potentially manipulative, and aligning with this consensus might help us eliminate a real threat without causing unnecessary division.

This pattern aligns with player_1's suspicions before their own elimination, indicating player_6 might be coordinating with the Mafia. With three Mafia still among us, eliminating player_6 could disrupt their strategy and buy us more time without risking parity."
