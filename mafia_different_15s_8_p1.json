With 9 players left and 3 Mafia among us, ignoring this lead could allow the Mafia to gain parity if we hesitate too long.

With three Mafia members among our nine remaining players, we must vote today to maintain our numerical advantage, but we need to be absolutely certain before eliminating anyone.
