While player_7's accusation of player_4 deserves consideration, we should remember the Mafia could have manipulated this statement to create division. With 9 players remaining and presumably 3 Mafia members, we civilians still maintain a safe majority for voting today, but we must be careful not to eliminate another civilian based on flimsy evidence.

With only 7 players left, we need to be cautious, but player_3's behavior has consistently raised red flags for me based on past discussions.

With only 7 players left, voting is risky, so I'm choosing to support this consensus to potentially eliminate a Mafia member while hoping for broader agreement to avoid a mistake.
