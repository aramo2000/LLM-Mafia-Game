Player_5's statement about investigating player_2 is significant; if true, it casts serious doubt on player_9's quick accusation.

With 3 Mafia members still among us, we need to be careful not to rush our votes today, as incorrect elimination gives them advantage.

While player_5's quietness is notable, I'm also trying to process everyone's initial reactions like player_6's and player_0's points before deciding who seems most suspicious.

Their immediate effort to cast doubt on player_6 while simultaneously calling for input from quieter players (including me) seems calculated to create confusion.

With three Mafia still among us and only seven players left, voting out player_0 today is crucial to prevent them from reaching parity and winning.

With multiple votes already on player_8, it seems like a reasonable target for Day 1 scrutiny, though I'm cautious about the risk of a misvote that could help the Mafia edge closer to parity. This vote allows us to test the waters without rushing into eliminating someone based on insufficient evidence."

The deflection against me feels like a tactic to protect player_0, so eliminating them aligns with gathering more evidence through outcomes.

Player_7's complete silence and refusal to vote throughout the entire game is extremely suspicious and unhelpful. With only four of us left, total inactivity like player_7's is far more indicative of someone hiding something than my attempts to defend myself against false claims.

Player_5 has been repeatedly mentioned by those eliminated, and their supposed clearance by the proven Mafia Don, player_9, is highly questionable.
