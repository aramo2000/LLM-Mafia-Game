While I agree we shouldn't repeatedly abstain from voting as that benefits the Mafia's path to parity, voting blindly today risks eliminating a civilian or even our Detective.

While we should be careful about rushing to vote, I'm concerned that excessive caution might be exactly what the Mafia wants - paralysis through fear of making the wrong choice.

With three mafia still hidden among nine players, a wrong vote now would be devastating - if we lose another civilian tonight followed by a mislynch tomorrow, mafia would reach parity.

I'm growing increasingly suspicious of player_3 for their consistent push to target me without concrete evidence, which feels like a coordinated effort to divert attention from potential Mafia among the more vocal players like themselves. To avoid another risky vote that could hand parity to the real Mafia, I'll vote to eliminate player_3 and urge others to reconsider the facts before we make a fatal mistake."
