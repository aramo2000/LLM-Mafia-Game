With only seven players left and likely three Mafia still active, failing to vote out a suspected Mafia member today risks reaching parity after the next night kill.

With only 4 civilians left against 3 Mafia, we risk immediate loss if we vote out an innocent, so I urge caution and further discussion before committing a vote.

Eliminating player_4 will bring us closer to parity, securing our victory, as I know from my investigations that they are not the detective and thus a civilian.

This aligns with player_4's concerns and helps us address potential threats without delaying the vote, especially since skipping it risks letting the Mafia reach parity with the remaining players.
