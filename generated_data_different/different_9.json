I'm wary of player_5 and player_6 for their quick alignment, as it could be a subtle way for Mafia to coordinate without drawing too much attention, similar to how player_7 and player_8 pointed out.

While player_7 and player_8 make valid observations about player_5 and player_6's alignment, I hesitate to fully support their conclusions without more evidence. With three Mafia likely remaining against six civilians, we still have room to observe behaviors before committing to a vote, though I agree we shouldn't let potential patterns of coordination between certain players go unexamined."
