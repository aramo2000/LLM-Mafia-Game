Unless player_0 can provide a very compelling defense, I think we should seriously consider trusting the Detective's findings to eliminate a potential Mafia member on Day 1.

With player_2 already eliminated and potentially 3 Mafia members remaining among 9 players, we still have the numbers to risk a vote without reaching Mafia parity. Player_0's defense seems weak, focusing more on questioning player_7's timing rather than providing a substantive alibi, which heightens my suspicion of them."

If we lynch an innocent now we\u2019d drop to 5 vs 3, dangerously closer to parity. With only one unverified claim from player_7, I\u2019d rather abstain and press them for more investigation details before targeting player_0."
