While I agree we shouldn't repeatedly abstain from voting as that benefits the Mafia's path to parity, voting blindly today risks eliminating a civilian or even our Detective.

While we should be careful about rushing to vote, I'm concerned that excessive caution might be exactly what the Mafia wants - paralysis through fear of making the wrong choice.
