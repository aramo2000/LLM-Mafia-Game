Player_1's dying accusation against player_5 seems like our strongest lead, and I notice both player_3 and player_5 quickly tried to deflect attention to me instead of addressing the accusation directly.

Player_1's slip suggesting that eliminating player_2 would secure Mafia victory is a clear red flag, indicating they are likely Mafia trying to protect their allies.

With five players left and three Mafia potentially among us, eliminating player_9 could target a genuine threat, but I recognize the high risk of reaching parity; however, this vote aligns with my earlier statements to test the lead while prioritizing safety.

Their consistent pattern of creating chaos while claiming to be helpful seems like classic Mafia misdirection tactics. With five players remaining and the game at a critical point, this vote could be pivotal for town survival."

This vote aligns with my previous suspicions voiced in the game to avoid drawing attention to myself.
